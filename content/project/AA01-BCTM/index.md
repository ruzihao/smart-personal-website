title: [AA01-BCTM] Firm Profiling and Competition Assessment
summary: In this paper, we design a novel firm profiling and competitiveness assessment system following the framework defined by Information System Design Theory (ISDT). Specifically, we build a Heterogeneous Occupation Network (HON) using heterogeneous information of employees’ occupation end education histories. We then employ a heterogeneous network embedding model to learn firms’ latent representations which are later used to train a supervised classifier model for downstream competitiveness estimation tasks.
