summary: In this paper, we design a novel firm profiling and competitiveness
  assessment system following the framework defined by Information System Design
  Theory (ISDT). Specifically, we build a Heterogeneous Occupation Network (HON)
  using heterogeneous information of employees’ occupation end education
  histories. We then employ a heterogeneous network embedding model to learn
  firms’ latent representations which are later used to train a supervised
  classifier model for downstream competitiveness estimation tasks.
