summary: Extensive eﬀorts have been made by both academics and practitioners to
  understand inter-ﬁrm competitive relationship owing to its profound impacts on
  multiple key business goals, e.g., company benchmarking, marketing strategy
  planning, and talent acquisition. However, it has never been an easy task to
  fully characterize ﬁrms and assess the competitive relationship among them
  mainly due to the challenge of information heterogeneity. In this regard, we
  propose a novel IT artifact for ﬁrm proﬁling and inter-ﬁrm competition
  assessment guided by Information System Design Theory (ISDT). We start by
  constructing a Heterogeneous Occupation Network (HON) using employees’
  occupation details and education attainments. Then we adopt a
  Methpath2Vec-based heterogeneous network embedding model to learn ﬁrms’ latent
  proﬁles (embeddings). Using the ﬁrm embeddings as input, we train multiple
  supervised classiﬁers to assess the competitive relationship among the ﬁrms.
  Following the logic of design as a search process, we demonstrate the utility
  of our IT artifact with extensive experimental study and in-depth discussions.
  Our study also reveals that employees’ occupation and education information
  signiﬁcantly contribute to the identiﬁcation of the focal ﬁrm’s potential
  competitors.
