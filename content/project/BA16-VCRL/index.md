summary: "Venture capital investments play a powerful role in fueling the
  emergence and growth of early-stage startups. However, only a small fraction
  of venture-backed startups can survive and exit successfully. Prior
  data-driven prediction-based or recommendation-based solutions are incapable
  of providing effective and actionable strategies on proper investment timing
  and amounts for startups across different investment rounds. In this paper, we
  develop a novel reinforcement learning-based method, AlphaVC, to facilitate
  venture capitalists’ decision-making. Our policy-based RL agents can
  dynamically identify the best candidates and sequentially place the optimal
  investment amounts at proper rounds to maximize financial returns for a given
  portfolio. We retrieve company demographics and investment activity data from
  Crunchbase and test our model in two industry sectors: Financial Services and
  Information Technology. Our methodology demonstrates its efficacy and
  superiority in both ranking and portfolio-based performance metrics in
  comparison with various SOTA baseline methods."
