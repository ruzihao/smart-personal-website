summary: Extracting typical career paths from large-scale and unstructured
  talent proﬁles has recently attracted increasing research attention. However,
  various challenges arise in effectively analyzing self-reported career
  records. Inspired by recent advances in neural networks and embedding models,
  we develop a novel career path clustering approach with two major components.
  First, we formulate an embedded Markov framework to learn job embeddings from
  longitudinal career records and further use them to compute dynamic embeddings
  of career paths. Second, to cope with heterogeneous career path clusters, we
  estimate a mixture of Markov models to optimize cluster-wise job embeddings
  with a prior embedded space shared by multiple clusters. We conduct extensive
  experiments with our framework to investigate its algorithmic performance and
  extract meaningful clustering patterns of career paths in the information
  technology (IT) industry. The results show that our approach can naturally
  discover distinct sequential path clusters and reveal valuable insights for
  career path characterization.
