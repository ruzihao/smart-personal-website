summary: Gaining highly skilled human capital is one of the primary reasons for
  corporate mergers and acquisitions (M&A), especially for knowledge intensive
  industry. However, the inevitable tensions brought by the divergent cultures
  and organizational misalignment during the M&A process result in high talent
  turnover rate and ultimately the integration failure. Hence, it is imperative
  to understand and prepare for the potential effects of M&A process on the
  employee turnover. To this end, we propose a novel dual-fit model induced
  heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict the talent turnover
  trend in the post-M&A process, by taking into account the complex relationship
  among the acquirer firm, the acquiree firm, and the acquired employees.
  Specifically, we creatively design a dual-fit model comprised of both the
  firm-level compatibility and employeefirm fit. Extensive evaluations on
  large-scale real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach.
