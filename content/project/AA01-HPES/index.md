summary: In this paper, we propose a Scalable Heterogeneous Graph Markov Neural
  Network (SHGMNN) for identifying the high-potential startups. The general idea
  is to use graph neural networks (GNN) to learn effective startup
  representations through end-to-end efficient training and model the label
  dependency among startups through Maximum A Posterior (MAP) inference.
