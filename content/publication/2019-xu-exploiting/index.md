abstract: It is commonly seen that social events are organized through online social network services (SNSs), and thus there are vested interests in studying event-oriented social gathering through SNSs. The focus of existing studies has been put on the analysis of event proﬁles or individual participation records. While there is signiﬁcant dynamic mutual inﬂuence among target users through their social connections, the impact of dynamic mutual inﬂuence on the people’s social gathering remains unknown. To that end, in this paper, we develop a discriminant framework, which allows to integrate the dynamic mutual dependence of potential event participants into the discrimination process. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the group-oriented event participation problem as a two-stage variant discriminant framework to capture the users’ proﬁles as well as their latent social connections. The validation on real-world data sets show that our method can effectively predict the event participation with a signiﬁcant margin compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. This validates the hypothesis that dynamic mutual inﬂuence could play an important role in the decision-making process of social event participation. Moreover, we propose the network pruning method to further improve the efﬁciency of our technical framework. Finally, we provide a case study to illustrate the application of our framework for event plan design task.
